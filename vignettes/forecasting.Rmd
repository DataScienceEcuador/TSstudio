The **TSstudio** package provides a set of functions for train, test, and evaluate time series forecasting models, this vignette covers the main ones.


## Creating testing and training partitons

The `ts_split` function split time series data into training (sample-in) and testing (sample-out) partitions, keeping the chronological order of the series. The `sample.out` argument defines the length of the testing partition. In the following example, we will use the function to split the `USgas` series (the monthly demand for natural gas in the US) into training and testing partitions, leaving the last 12 months as testing partition:

```{r}
library(TSstudio)

data(USgas)

ts_info(USgas)

USgas_par <- ts_split(USgas, sample.out = 12)

train <- USgas_par$train

test <- USgas_par$test

ts_info(train)
ts_info(test)


```


## Forecast perfromance 

The `test_forecast` function visualizes the performance of a forecasting model on the training and testing partitions by plotting the fitted and forecasted values against the actuals. For example, let's train a `tslm` model on the `train` partition and forecast the corresponding observations of the `test` partition:

```{r}
library(forecast)

md <- tslm(train ~ season + trend)

fc <- forecast(md, h = 12)
```

Using the actual series (`USgas`), forecast object (`fc`), and the corresponding testing partition (`test`), the function will plot the fitted and forecasted values against the actuals:

```{r}
test_forecast(actual = USgas,
              forecast.obj = fc,
              test = test)
```

The MAPE and RMSE score of both the fitted and forecasted values can be seen when hovering on the plot. 

**Note:** that the function supports forecast objects from the `forecast` and `stats` packages.
