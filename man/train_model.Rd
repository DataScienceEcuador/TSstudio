\usage{
train_model(input, methods, train_method, horizon, error = "MAPE",
  xreg = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{A univariate time series object (ts class)}

\item{methods}{A list, defines the models to use for training and forecasting the series. 
The list must include a sub list with the model type, and the model's arguments (when applicable) and notes about the model. 
The sub-list name will be used as the model ID. Possible models:

\code{\link[stats]{arima}} - model from the stats package 

\code{\link[forecast]{auto.arima}} - model from the forecast package

\code{\link[forecast]{ets}} - model from the forecast package

 \code{\link[stats]{HoltWinters}} - model from the stats package 

\code{\link[forecast]{nnetar}} - model from the forecast package

\code{\link[forecast]{tslm}} - model from the forecast package (note that the 'tslm' model must have the formula argument in the 'method_arg' argument)}

\item{train_method}{A list, defines the train approach, either using a single testing partition (sample out) 
or use multiple testing partitions (backtesting). The list should include the training method argument, (please see 'details' for the structure of the argument)}

\item{horizon}{An integer, defines the forecast horizon}

\item{error}{A character, defines the error metrics to be used to sort the models leaderboard. Possible metric - "MAPE" or "RMSE"}

\item{xreg}{Optional, a list with two vectors (e.g., data.frame or matrix) of external regressors, 
one vector corresponding to the input series and second to the forecast itself 
(e.g., must have the same length as the input and forecast horizon, respectively)}
}
\description{
Method for train test and compare multiple time series models using either one partition (i.e., sample out) 
or multipe partitions (backtesting)
