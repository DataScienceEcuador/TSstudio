\title{Moving Average Time Series Data}
\usage{
ts_ma(ts.obj, k = c(3, 6, 9), double = NULL, plot = TRUE,
  multiple = FALSE, title = NULL, Xtitle = NULL, Ytitle = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{ts.obj}{a univariate time series object of a class "ts", "zoo" or "xts" (support only series with either monthly or quarterly frequency)}

\item{k}{A single or multiple integers (by default using 3, 6 and 9), set the amount of past and future periods to use for calculating the moving average}

\item{double}{A single integer, an optional argument. If not NULL (by default), will apply a second moving average process on the initial moving average output}

\item{plot}{A boolean, if TRUE will plot the results}

\item{multiple}{A boolean, if TRUE (and k > 1) will create multiple plots, one for each moving average degree. By default is set to FALSE}

\item{title}{A character, if not NULL (by default), will use the input as the plot title}

\item{Xtitle}{A character, if not NULL (by default), will use the input as the plot x - axis title}

\item{Ytitle}{A character, if not NULL (by default), will use the input as the plot y - axis title}
}

Calculate the moving average (and double moving average) for time series data

\examples{

# Using moving average to smooth the USVsales dataset (US Monthly Total Vehicle Sales)
# Applying 4 degrees of moving average   
USVS_MA <- ts_ma(ts.obj = USVSales, k = c(3, 6, 9, 12))

# Plot only the moving average with k = 12
ts_plot(USVS_MA$ma_12, title = "Moving Average, k = 12")

# Using moving average to smooth the USgas dataset (US Monthly Natural Gas Consuption)
# Adding double moving average with degree of 6 to smooth the strong seasonality
USgas_MA <- ts_ma(ts.obj = USgas, k = c(6, 9), double = 6)

# Extract the plot
USgas_MA$plot
